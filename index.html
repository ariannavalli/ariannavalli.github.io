<h1>Arianna Valli</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi! I’m Arianna and this is my personal website :)</p>
<p>I come from the countryside near Perugia (Italy) and I’m an undergraduate student in Physics at the University of Trento. <br>
In particular, I’ve recently become interested in <b>Mathematical Physics</b>, a field that lies at the intersection between
Theoretical Physics and Applied Mathematics.<br>
Beyond the “pure” aspects of these disciplines, I’m passionate about the history of Physics and Mathematics. </p>
<p>I’m also the public relations manager of the Trento committee of the <b>Italian Association of Physics Students</b> (AISF). <br>
Additionally, I’m often active in initiatives to promote <b>equity and diversity in STEM</b>, especially about women in STEM.</p>
