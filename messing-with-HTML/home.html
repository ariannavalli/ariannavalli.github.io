<h1>Messing with HTML</h1>
<p>As most people born in the early 2000s, I've spent hours surfing on the internet and playing
online games on my favourite cartoons' websites. I've only recently realised that creating my own webpages
and making them look however I want is rather easy. Below you'll find my clunky attempts to teach myself HTML and feed my 
nostalgia of the early internet. All source code is free and available on my GitHub repository,
in case any weirdo wants to recreate these projects themselves.</p>
